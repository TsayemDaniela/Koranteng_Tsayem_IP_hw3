Implementation

We used the equation specified in the homework writeup.

Self-Chosen Images
test1.jpg:
This image is a bunch of red roses.
We used bin-size 1 for this image. The mutual information score was highest at x=40.
The output is in the mi_plot1.png file.

test2.jpg:
This image is a bunch of blueberries.
We used bin-size 1 for this image. The mutual information score was highest at x=40.
The output is in the mi_plot2.png file.

test3.jpeg:
This image is a green plant.
We used bin-size 1 for this image. The mutual information score was highest at x=0.
The output is in the mi_plot3.png file.

We used bin-sizes 3, 51 and 255 for this image. 
The mutual score is highest at 0 and the graphs all look the same around 40.
